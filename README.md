My project is my personal website that was built by Vue3 and Vite using vscode. The website has a home section, contact section, counter, a footer and header. The contact section allows you to send a message to us. The counter is a feature that updates the count for each time a button is clicked. I used concepts such as v-model for binding, v-on while count each time the button will click. Computed() will diplay the number of projects, etc. I learned how to code from the github repository link for the first time. Some things that have been challenging was using watch() correctly. Adding the inputs and logs was a struggle based on the format.
